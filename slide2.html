                After several state, city and county government imposed 'stay at home' quarantines to
                stem the spread of the virus, facing economic uncertainty many businesses laid-off their employees,
                resulting in the highest unemployment rate since the great recession.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the great recession, economic recovery was made faster due to the rapid development
                of COVID-19 vaccine and rapid distribution of the vaccine. Businesses had more optimistic outlook
                at the end of pandemic that resulted in more hiring and unemployment rate back
                to pre-pandemic level in 2022
